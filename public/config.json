  "introduction": "In this part of my journey I am learning to read and write as per the advice of Dr.Jordan Peterson, So this is an attempt at doing just that. And since I've been journalling all my life I know how helpful it is to organize and put thoughts into words. So this's a place to host all my writings and I hope it inspires, motivates and helps you grow as it does to me. Enjoy!",
