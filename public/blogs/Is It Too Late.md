# Is it too late?

So last year I was 22 and in love, thinking I had my whole life planned out and I thought I had nothing to worry about. As they say, I felt like the world was my oyster. In the second year of my software engineering degree, I had a perfect grade and went to church every morning. You can say I was completely and utterly in a joyful free fall through life.

This year, to say the least, has been one of the most challenging years of my life. Broke up with the woman I thought to be my whole life, lost the perfect grade, and somewhat lost my faith. I was angry at everyone and definitely obsessed with the idea that a 23rd-year-old me wouldn’t matter in this world. I didn’t have the best childhood, nor was I the luckiest when it came to finances. The funny thing was nothing changed within the year other than that single experience, but it made me so annoyed I ended up finding reasons for how I felt everywhere but the right place. I always thought I wasn’t the brightest, even when I had the better grade. I just thought I was a fraud waiting for his day to be caught.

So today I decided to ask the question: Is it too late?

_Answer to Yonatan,_ You spent your whole life learning how to start things but not finish them, to fight with yourself, tear yourself down in every way possible. Being an only child didn't help; you spent more time in your head, talking down every good and bright idea that you had. You had no light in your life other than what people brought into it. You followed the script that you wrote, but it was all a trap. The truth is you are just scared—scared of losing when it counts, scared of not being smart enough to fight for what you truly want. Why do you think you can fight for something that benefits them, but when it comes to your life, you are your own villain? I don't have the answer; hence, why I am writing this rather than going to class but I do hope life makes a bit more sense tomorrow than it does now.

But the truth is, if you can publish this now, I know you will end up becoming stronger today than you were last week. Because you’ve seen worse days pass, just like the day continues to do so.
