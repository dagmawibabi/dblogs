# The Pain You Caused Me

> This poem secretly has the name of the person within the lines. Can you See it?

## The pain you've caused me
## I wish I could describe it to you!
## Sleepless nights not just a few
## but 7 days in a week!
## Sleepless nights filled with tears
## that's how I was all these years!
## So weak and tired couldn't ever face my fears!
## Covering my face with my blanket so nobody has to see my tears!
## Making the music so loud that I don't have to hear my own thoughts but it's hurting my ears.
## Became so sensitive that the slightest things make me so upset
## depressed and sad wishing it was onset!
## Wishing it would be okay,when I'm offset!
## You don't know who you are, but look closer dear!
## Misery loves Misery somehow I lost the way to victory.
## Everybody can see the scars you put on me,the injury!
## Defined and is clear, it is not a mystery.
## Hopeful and adventurous, that was our history!
## And we went through that path where it was all slippery.
## Never have I thought that you'd lose me there, but my vision became so blurry!
## It felt so bitterly!
## Thinking and knowing for sure that I'll never see you again,wasn't my favorite memory!
## Did you find yourself?!
## Well I'm still lost in here
## with nothing but fear!
