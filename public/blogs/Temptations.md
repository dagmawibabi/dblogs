# Temptations

Temptations are those that point us away from what is Good. And then the rest is up to us (it’s pending our choice)

> EVERYONE gets tempted
> 

> They can be small or big. Regarding their consequences
> 

Usually we emphasis on what the bad things Temptations are leading us to, and forget about the things Temptations are leading us away.

1. You have to know your triggers. 
2. Try to navigate through your triggers. Have a solid game plan for the ones you can’t avoid. 
3. Stop temptation at the door [ Thought → Imaginations → Delight → Attractions → Consent ]
4. Temptation, no matter how strong it is, will pass. It is temporary. The devil knocks and knocks and when you don’t fail or respond, it passes. Wait for 30 minutes and do something else.  Tough times don’t last, Tough people do. 
    
    The best weapon against temptation is PATIENCE.
    
5. The benefits of temptations 
    - They teach us something about ourselves. They show us our gaps and brokenness.
    - It builds strength. Each temptation is an opportunity to build strength. At first we can only tackle tiny temptations, then mid, then heavier and then help others overcome their temptations too.
    - Beating temptations boosts confidence. Those that overcame their temptations are those that win.
6. We are never gonna be free from temptations. We just know how to deal with them. Just get over the next hour, the day, the week…
7. When you fail, keep going. Don’t be defeated by guilt, self hate and more. They are more temptations. 
8. Surrender to God, and pray. Let him fight your battles too.
