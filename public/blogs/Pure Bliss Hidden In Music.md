# Pure bliss hidden in Music.

_“Turn your lights down low” by Bob Marley_ - My first memory of a song I heard after my first crush. 6th grade in pure bliss saying _"I know exactly what he's singing about for sure"_ felt a fuzzy warmth inside my then very small heart. I remember reading about how music evokes emotional responses that resemble a “high”. That was my first experience of getting high on the profound impact of rhythm, melody, and lyrics even though I had no idea what the words fully meant. That’s what people call a lasting impression.

Then I was older in high school, going to class with headphones on and listening to _Chris Brown's “Next to You”_ singing along thinking I could dance like he does in the video. For the next couple of years, I was all into hip-hop going through the emotions like most teenagers. I kinda remember thinking like those years would last a lifetime.

I still get hit by the feeling of nostalgia when I hear those songs on a random day on a random taxi I happen to be taking. It’s really interesting how we keep those connections even after so many years. I still have that feeling of being socially bonded to the first day I danced to _Patoranking’s “My Woman, My Everything”_ with friends I thought would be part of my entire life but never saw each other after a couple of years, but I still remember those days. I still smile when I hear that song.

Fresh in uni, the first time I ever felt like I loved someone in so many ways it made me think about what _“love”_ really meant to this thing we call our life. Walks at night, having juice at a cafe after a 10-minute taxi ride, setting face-to-face sun going down, light on her back listening to _Benny Blanco, Halsey & Khalid's “Eastside”_ —

    we can do anything if we put our minds to it
    Take your whole life then you put a line through it
    My love is yours if you’re willing to take it
    Give me your heart ’cause I ain’t gonna break it
    So come away, starting today
    Start a new life, together in a different place
    We know that love is how these ideas came to be
    So baby, run away, away with me

I truly meant those words, and thinking about how that song was a soundtrack to that point in my life, hearing it now brings up so many days from all those years ago. It really fascinates me how a piece of music made literally thousands of miles away ends up becoming a bookmark on my lifeline.

Guess the point is, music is intertwined with so many of my memories and emotions. It has created a tapestry of experiences that will probably stay with me throughout my life. Without knowing it, I curated soundtracks to different stages of my life, and those songs and many more are my time machines, getting me back to moments in my life when I was in pure bliss.
