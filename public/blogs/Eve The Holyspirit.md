# Eve The Holyspirit

> This is one of the most beautiful concepts I've stumbled upon

**A couple of days ago on reddit I asked a seemingly simple question; "If God was there in the Garden with Adam, why did God say that it wasn't good for Man to be alone?" And expecting a very simple answer I was met with this beautiful reply. Here it is...**

At first, when God said, "it's not good for man to be alone." It seemed like an incomplete thought, because God didn't elaborate on the reasons why, or the detrimental impact of man being alone.

In Genesis 1:26, God said let us make man in our own image.

# Who's us?

No one knew who "us" was, but later we find out that God the Father used Jesus to make the universe, and without Jesus nothing was made that had been made.

When God said "its not good for man to be alone," He was speaking from experience, because God Himself was not alone. As Jesus states in John 17:5, Jesus, God's son, was there all along, at God’s side, sharing in God's glory, sharing in the joy of God’s creation, and sharing in the joy of God’s devine plan for humanity.

As God begins to unpack his plans for salvation, we begin to understand the wisdom behind not being alone and having someone by your side to support you. In Ecclesiastes 4:9-12, a man and a woman, married and serving God is a formidable force in all aspects of life.

# Here's the banger...

Jesus is considered the second Adam--a life giving spirit. We who believe in Jesus are all being transformed into the image and likenesses of Jesus(The second Adam). Once again, God echoes the thought that, "it is not good for man to be alone. So, much so, that God sends us a spiritual Eve in the form of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is supposed to live with us, and within us forever. The Holy Spirit is supposed to be our helper and counselor. The first Eve ate of the fruit and gave some to her husband, and humanity was condemned. The second Eve comes from God, guides us in all righteousness, and guarantees us citizenship into eternity(everlasting life).

> Ecclesiastes 4:8-12 There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. “For whom am I toiling,” he asked, “and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?” This too is meaningless— a miserable business! Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.
