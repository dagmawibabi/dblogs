# Horrible Web Designs

On December 14 I hosted a ***5,000 ETB*** web dev competition in Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU) for all batches. The theme of the competition was **Horrible Design** and contestants were expected to make the most difficult to use, hedious looking, unintuitive, user-unfriendly, time wasting abomination of a website... and they didn't fail me! 

# This was what I told the contestants 
When I look at your websites I want to gag and feel immense pain in my soul. I want my eyes to be in agony looking at your designs. Are you good at UI/UX design? Well throw that out the window. Do you like making people's digital life easier? Well throw that out the window as well. Do you follow good design and interaction guidelines? Throw that out the window!! Infact when I look at your designs, I want it to make me throw MY computer out the window!! Enjoy causing pain on all of us and go crazy with your creativity. Competition starts now and ends in 3 days. Have fun. 🥳
