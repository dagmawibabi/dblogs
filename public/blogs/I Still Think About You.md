# I still think about you.

**Pain:** _(noun)_ great care or trouble.  
The first word. I learned the world wasn’t a fair place to live in when I was 9. I still somewhat remember how sad that made me, and I remember being hopeful that it will turn out better as well. I don’t know why but that’s the last memory I have of me accepting that the people that left my life won’t be coming back, and by then it had already been a couple of years, so it took me a lot of years to truly understand how real pain trembles your body, gives you that small dose of anxiety that you can’t seem to shake, and always seems to be a certain someone that makes it all better just for you.

**Love:** _(noun)_ an intense feeling of deep affection.  
The second word. Managed to experience a lot more of that pain we talked about as I grew older. Figured out more things about how the world worked but knew I didn’t have the answer to any of it, and I was somewhat complacent with what I had. Then came love, “That someone that makes it all better,” and I had a new perspective on how the world was unfair. It was unfair because she wasn’t by my side every second that passed. It was unfair because no matter how much I loved her, it still felt like I wanted to love her more. I wanted to take all the love I could ever have and make sure she had it all, then that’s when I remembered.

**Pain:** _(noun)_ great care or trouble.  
The first word. I remember the first time I held her hand, the first time I saw her eyes, the first time I took a breath in her presence full of so much joy I thought that was it; I found that Love, a lot of firsts I can write for miles. A lot of days I can still recall just like they're happening right now, and so many ways I still care about you.

**Love:** _(noun)_ an intense feeling of deep affection.  
The second word. A good song, a funny meme, a great book, a thoughtful film, and just a random thing I want to show you. A bad day, a painful night, a terrible week, and a fight with Mom I want to talk to you about. Hours and hours of just you, a lifetime of just us. That’s what Love is in my world, and I still think about you.

**Pain:** _(noun)_ mental suffering or distress.  
The first word but a different meaning. The last day.
