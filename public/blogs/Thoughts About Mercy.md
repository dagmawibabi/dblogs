# God’s Mercy

When talking about forgiveness from God. It feels easy. Do I just confess my sins and repent and that's it? I'm forgiven? And that being true makes it look so easy.

But one thing we often miss looking at is that this is easy for you and me. To just confess and repent. It's easy for us but the amount of pain and suffering Jesus had to go through to make it this easy for us to be instantly forgiven is unmentionable.

What made it possible for God to forgive us this easily is the fact that Jesus suffered insanely. It wasn't easy for him to go through all that, but he did make it easy for us to be forgiven and accepted.

This forgiveness is made free for all of us, but it isn't cheap. It was paid for by the blood and tears of Jesus Christ. 

And connected to this is the constant bothering of the devil in your ears. Telling you that it can't be this easy, to be forgiven this fast.

He'll often come and tell you that there's no physical proof of your forgiveness. He'll tell you that you're just the same person, guilt tripping you into thinking how many times you're going to keep sinning and keep asking for forgiveness.

He'll often make the case that sin isn't external, but it is what you are. That you are fighting yourself and your identity when you're asking for forgiveness. Making you think that you are being apologetic for being yourself.

But the case isn't that. The devil may put in some sprinkle of truth, but he's inevitably a lair. It's what he does, it's what he is. So even if you feel like he's being honest, he's lying to you.

And so, even if you feel like you can't keep sinning and asking for forgiveness, no one is keeping count of your sins except the devil and you. The moment you ask for forgiveness, you are forgiven and God's looking at you like you had never sinned before, with new eyes.

And I know it's not easy to picture that cause we often fail to look at people the same after we forgive them. But for God it's made possible cause the amount of sacrifice he made for us makes it possible.

And so when the devil whispers just know that the grace of God is much more than what you or the devil can count.
