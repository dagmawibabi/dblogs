# A letter to void and loneliness.

Hey you two, I hope you're as void and lonely as it gets. I heard you two got engaged and now planning your wedding. It's beautiful to hear. 

I'm really happy that I got invited to the wedding, ofc I expected nothing less since we all used to live together. I was delightful when I was opening the invitation package. I had to tip the delivery boy, grief, $5 bucks cause he had to stay out at my door until I came back from work. He was a kind kid but looked a bit down as usual. But the tip did make him smile abit, can't say it was genuine tho.

Anyways, I was working on my speech for the wedding. I'm reading a lot of books written by dispair to inspire most of my speech. Cause I remember he used to be your favorite author back when we used to live together. 

I was thinking of writing about the sweet nights we had. Oh my God, do you remember those nights?? Ohw they were so awful and tearful. Just the way you two liked them. Ohw and that night we all cut so much that we had to cover our sleeves for like months. Oh my God, those nights were different. Ohw and who can forget our favorite night, where we stayed up late just talking about all the regretful and guilty nights we spent and we couldn't stop eachother from breaking down at the corners of the room. Man we had a blast back then. 

I always knew you two went well together. It was obvious but I guess I was too naive to notice it much. There were signs I noticed but it all makes sense now. How void always stays up late till loneliness came back from work. Ohw and how loneliness always stole your hoodies. I sometimes felt like the thirdwheel but it had to be extreme. You two always made me part of you. Loneliness would make me cry while void would tell me stories of how people left me. Void, I rmr you would always stay longer than loneliness had long gone. And I rmr asking you why but you always say what you always said, "we become aware of the void as we fill it." But that never answered my question. Cause I was always curious why the feeling of emptyness occupied so much space.

Thinking of both your futures together fills me with dispair and pitty. I can only imagine how incredible your children would be. And the life all of you will lead together. I know you two are deeply in love. 

I know how you are the flip sides of a coin. At the end of the day, Loneliness is void begging to be filled. So void, take care of her as you took care of me and even more. And loneliness fill out void as you had filled me with tears.

Yours truly! Depressed Kid.
